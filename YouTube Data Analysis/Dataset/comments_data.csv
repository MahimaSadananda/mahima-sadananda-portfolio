This is such an interesting and unusual song musically, very different to other Pop songs.', 'Yuppp', ""\u200b if you love God you will keep his commands meaning repentance from sin and giving up your desires to follow him.\n\n\nWell first of all we're born to have a relationship with God and to do his will for our life.❤\n\nJesus is the way the truth and the life no one gets to the father except through jesus❤ \n\nSatan doesnt rule hell, when lucifer known as satan rebelled against God and fell from pride he took 1/3 angels with him which are now called fallen angels. Hell was made for satan and his angels but the reason why people go there is because they align themselves with the fallen angels in sin.\n\n\n no surprise people love playing when it comes to your soul, but don't play around when it comes to their temporary body, if you were in the hospital because if a broken leg that might not work ever again you're praying your scared and worried bc for the rest of your life, you may never get to walk again. \n\n\nBut this is about your soul the enternal part of you that lives forever and you're literally playing with it when the end is literally Hell the lake of fire for enternity.\n\n\nYou have insurance on your house if it ever caught on fire but that rarely happens But when it comes to your soul you like to play with it like it's a game. Oh how fun of a game it is too play oh how many and actually MOST. People play with their soul like a Toy taking chances aye bro hang off that cliff XD literally the bottom is death! And you're playing with your life to make a cool picture of a funny video But this is about your soul.\n\n\n\nWhen you're probably not even saved you think you just need to be a good person or work hard to get to heaven well let me ask God that's not in his word it's not what he said it's not what I heard.\n\n\n\nAccept him as lord and savior Jesus died on the cross for our sins so he made it a free gift it's FREE \n\n\nThink about it you don't work for the gifts you get on your birthday and you don't buy them it's a gift!\n\nSame for Jesus he offered enternal life as a gift and to receive it, it must be done by faith. I'm not mad at you Love❤💖✨ I'm telling you this because I Love you. \n\n\nNo I don't know who you are or anything about you but God is love and he looks down at you as if you were the only person in the whole universe❤\n\n\nHe sees you and you alone for he is God we are just average people when we look at a person we can see the others around them but God is almighty he is not limited by power or time. But we are and so is Satan. \n\n\nRemember God loves you more then you love that person or thing you love most In the world ya know? That person or item you can't imagine living without it?❤ But you're free of choice so you choose light or darkness and even if you decide not to choose, it means you didn't choose the light.\n\nDon't waste time instead come to God he is your reason for life that's why so many become depressed it's because if sin and the devil's lies.\n\n\nBe honest and serious about this Do you want your family or your friends to Go to hell for enternity?\n\nWould YOU wanna go there for enternity? I'm not playing about this sarcasm is okay but not in situations like this.\n\n\nYou're only truly saved from Hell when you're spiritually reborn and receive his Holy spirit now do YOU have that Holy spirit? The fruits of the holy spirit \n\n\n\nAre: Love Joy peace kindness  faithfulness generosity gentleness self control and patience❤\n\nWhen you have the holy spirit you will have conviction when you sin MEANING guilt and shame you no longer desire evil things but you desire God and Holy things you desire to BE holy you sin and it's not even what you wanna do but when you're truly saved sin is no longer something you enjoy those bad songs cussing drinking\n\n\nHurting others.❤\n\n\nLove isn't just a feeling LOVE IS DOING when Jesus died on the cross for the whole worlds sins he proved his love HE DID SOMETHING God offered his son to die on that cross for your sins and my sins and so many people are taking advantage why is repentance why should we repent? Because\n\n\nOkay so example you're not married, so you could go up to anyone and talk to them and even try to date them right? Try to build a relationship and that's okay bc you're single\n\n\n\nBut wait now you're married, now you would be cheating you would be rude to go up to someone else after being with her/ him for so long you would feel ashamed right?\n\n\nSo why is it that you receive Jesus offer as a FREE GIFT when he went through spiritual and physical pain on that cross for you and gave you enternal life, after he did all that why would you spit on someone or hurt them for saving your life? But Jesus saved your SOUL. Do you understand? You love your wife*example not real* why would you cheat on her after all the things she/he has done for you. Or husband.\n\n\nSo to be saved:\n\nAccept Jesus as lord and savior by faith\n\nReceive his Holy spirit\nBe reborn again\n\n\nAnd repent from sin\n\n\nPeople like billy graham DLM christian lifestyle\nMapalo\n\nAre good places to start.\nHave you ever lied? Well then you're a liar have you ever stolen something? Well then your a theif\nHave you ever used Gods name in vain?\nWell then you blasphemy\n\nLike saying oh my God or Jesus Christ or cussing \n\nWhen you're angry or surprised and God doesn't judge us by our good works\n\nHe judges by the 10 commandments so if you broken one law if you've done one sin you're guilty! You broken all of it!\nExample:\nLike a normal judge okay you've murdered people the judge is gonna show you how serious this really is they are gonna give you the death sentence \n\n\nAnd God is a righteous judge so he's gonna show you how serious sin is in his eyes the punishment for sin is Hell!🔥\n\nMore people go to hell than heaven the path to destruction is easy and wide and many people find it\n\nBut the path to eternal life is hard and very few people find it.\n\n\nSo No, it's not that good people go to heaven and bad people go to hell\n\n\nForgiven people go to heaven the people who accepted Jesus as lord and savior by faith\n\n\nAnd the people who go to hell are the ones who lived in sin and died in sin and denied the free gift of salvation\n\n\n\nWhat have you been doing your whole life? All this time while you could have been serving God you choose to go out and party and stuff\n\n\nAnother question is God apart of your life, or is God your Life? a difference between apart of your life and being your life❤\n\nSo when Jesus died on the cross and if you accept him God won't remember your sins he has a special power that he can use to forget our sins Jesus paid full price of sins now your job is to receive it by faith like earlier \n\nThe judge tells you you're guilty but your fine has been paid your outta here. That's what Jesus did for us paid for our sins so that through him the world might be saved bc many deny him and die in their sins❤\n\nWatch living waters on youtube❤✨❤❤\n\nThere's a difference between lukewarms religious people and genuine reborn True christians with the Holy spirit religion can't save you.\n\nGoing to church reading the Bible and praying are good things but that's not what saves you❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"", 'Also her CD album moonlight', 'Why do I get like zombieland zombie clown feels with this song', 'literal queen', 'Ame está rola...desde que la escuché...adoro!!! 💋💋💋💋🎧🎧🎧🎧💕💕💕💕💖💖💖💖💖💖', ""I'm on an island❤"", 'The transition at 36 seconds is where I go from loving this song to hating it', '😢 yep 😢 nothing I get it no worries never is never yes 😮']"

I have a playlist with Shivers in it, plus a few of your other songs. I'm going to go back to the beginning and learn Small Bump. Coffee, Sofa, You need me more than I need you.

It was the only song he couldn't master for his summer entertainment job at Cedar Point in Sandusky Ohio. Oh, I failed to mention we were both born in Ohio-- me at least 5? Years older than Brady. We met when I moved to Atlanta Georgia, my bf dumped me and so I moved closer to work in midtown. Brady and i connected during a group run with Front Runners, Atlanta. While we never dated, he was like a younger version of my older brother who also served in the military. Kind, generous, happy, inclusive, etc. For his kindness, respect and encouragement I will always be grateful. My life has been empty since you returned to Heaven. I only hope that my love and total submission to Gött will reunite us in the far future. See, when Brady died so did an Angel that walked amoung us on this here blue marble we call Earth. The only known or even predicted habitable planet in the Universe. The more we scientist learn, the more our Gött revealsv or shows of his design. Calculations beyond chance at 10^18 power of accuracy for many factors (distance to the sun, placement of Jupiter to protect the Earth from meteor strikes, thickness of the crust/mantle, amount of nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and helium in our breathable atmosphere, the amount of drinkable water, gardens and animals provided for nutrients, corn for food, ethanol fuel, animal feed, even base material for takeaway containers and utensils --to name a few.

No choice but to find a place two days after High School graduation. Government support ends at the age of 18 or once graduated from high school, whichever comes first. Unfortunately, our apartment lease aligned with the school year. Nothing like packing while trying to study and finish school for Uni.\n\nFortunately a friend and his parents adopted me when i met him in 1984, we graduated in 1991. Unfortunately we were as far apart in the city as we could be for two people that had parents or a non driving parent. We were probably 30 miles apart, but it was 3 hours by bus and required 5 miles of walking to see each other at least once a month. Anyway, thanks Ed. You saved my life numerous times the year offer the past ten months. Feel free to go over and hear me attempt to reproduce a fraction of your gift.\n\nI had my access to the outside world removed for 35 days 10/03/23-11/07/23. Can't and won't pay to recover my used car that i scraped up the funds to purchase that was a refurbished hybrid for a friend in Cleveland Ohio. Despite the couple cutting over 20% of the 6d listing just to help me ($1500). Not including the test drive, i drove 2 miles before someone backed into it while parked. Causing me to be arrested for asking him why he backed into a space with a vehicle in it already. Instead of rolling down the window, acknowledging my Knocking or even driving off if scared as claimed... He reached for something in his console and kept his back to me. My charge Criminal Trespass. His charge for hitting my car. Nothing. Not even an attempt to get and provide his insurance info to me by the 4 police cars that responded in 55s, since the police station is less than .25 miles from my house or the station.

You being not much older than me, i really resonated with your first few works (loose change and +). You really highlighted the feeling of what its like to be simply young and discovering love. Now were older, wiser, and perhaps more lost than ever. And i know you probably think it too. Time goes so fast and yet so slow at the same time.. our youth escapes us, and all we want is to feel a glimpse of what we had. And with great loss, that glimpse gets even more scarce, until we can hardly find the person we used to be. We try to not to change, but the world changes for us. We never expect to lose anyone, but when we do, all we can think of is how devastated our family and friends will be when it's our time to go. We just want to keep it all together, not for ourselves but for our loved ones. Thank you Ed, youre a true inspiration. As modest as you are i know you probably dont like dealing with fans 24/7 but if one day we met id give you a huge hug , not because youre famous, and not because of views or money. But because you put your heart on the line for us. When were all going through a tough time you give us your heart in these songs and everyone of us can feel this and know that were not alone with our loss and even the most brilliant people in the world or the most reknowned are still human and still feel what were feeling everyday. I see you in your star light and i wonder if youve ever thought what it would be like if all this never happened for you. Youd probably say it would  happen anyway because you worked so hard for it. But i guess all im trying to say is, i can see how family oriented you are, and how much you enjoy the little things in life. And i feel bad that you have to deal with so much alll the time, youve given us such great music. I wish you could just take a break for a while and really be where you need to be with your friends and family. All i want to say is thanks.

I say to you that anyone who does not enter the🤔 sheepfold by the door, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber.  But the one who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter opens, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his sheep by name, and brings🤨 them out. And when he brings out his sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice. But they will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers. Jesus told them this parable; but they did not understand what he was saying to them. Jesus therefore said to them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the door; if anyone enters by me, he will be saved, and will go in and out, and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal, to kill, and to destroy; I came that they might have life, and have it more abundantly. I am the good shepherd; the good Shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. But the hired hand, and he who is not a shepherd, whose sheep do not belong, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters the sheep. Now the hireling flees, because he is a hireling, and does not care for the sheep. I am the good Shepherd, and I know my sheep, and of mine I am known.']"

Then I never really listend to Harry’s music anymore because we both found new artists that we loved at that time.\nJuly 2022 I was on a summer holiday trip with that same best friend and we were in the car and the radio was on.\nA song played and my dad asked wich song that was and my best friend said ,, that’s As it was by Harry Styles“.\nI‘ve heard it before on the internet but I never really payed much attention to it and that evening after hearing As it was on the radio I scrolled through YouTube and a lot of videos of Harry’s concerts were on my page. People screaming ,, Leave America“ and other fun stuff.\nEvery day I watched more videos like those and started to like it a lot, but I didn‘t listened to the new album at that time.\nA few weeks after the summer trip I saw a clip and Little freak was playing in the background but not the full song.\nSo then I finally listend to the whole song and it was immediately my new favorite song.

I watched while I was in England and they never were really thrilled with being made into a band and then Harry and Liam both wanting to be the lead. Zayne was actually at that time the one with the best voice and he got the least parts and Simon telling him everything he did was wrong. I love this song and how it feels like you could listen to it in any decade. Same with “As It Was” and then other songs are completely different. I think both songs were about his relationship with Taylor. In “Little Freak” all the indicators are there and it is kind of his way of saying he really messed up a good thing because he was new to fame and “As It Was” is a more mature him saying basically he thinks all it could ever be is a friendship and not the relationship it was.

Why not make such an organization international, under the UN.

All seemed to be going well. However, in October 2023, the world was shocked to see Palestinian Bedouins launch a brazen attack on the Israelis catching the Israelis off guard. It's been a month and the rest of the world has given Israel support in terms of lip service. However, no country is sending troops to help the Israelis defend their security. One could say that the Mighty is stabbing the Jews in the back. They stabbed Him in the back first thousands of years ago.

He took her to Yorkshire after putting some duck boots on her from London since Yorkshire rains a lot. She let him tie her shoes so he knew he was ok in her eyes. He put her on his horse and they rode off. She didn't say much but seemed to like taking walks as the Vietnamese are used to walking.

Once upon a time, there was a little Vietnamese Catholic refugee girl who had rebel angel boy friends from the East End of London. The British were concerned and sent a naval officer from Yorkshire to see what it was all about.

People say it happens all the time, that people are inherently two-faced etcc.... but when it happens to you, it's personal. In 1975, the Americans left their Vietnamese allies holding the bag.

The speaker is reminiscing back on their life and feel that it is abruptly coming to an end. That is why they are thinking about the things they really want to do in their last moments, for someone to just hear them out and understand them, tell them lies like things are going to be alright, to make them believe that love is real and life is all worth it. The speaker is obviously despairing. They want it all to matter towards the end. They want someone to just notice them and to feel how they are feeling at such a despondent state.\n""Sorry, can\'t save me now. Sorry I don\'t know how. Sorry there\'s no way out, but down.""\nBy the end, they are saying their goodbyes. They are sorry for their actions and for carrying on with the deed. They know that there is no saving them, or that they can turn back. They are fixed towards the idea. They need to k*ll themselves.\n\nI listen to this when my heart has stopped feeling everything. It\'s when I can\'t bring myself to cry even more. And it\'s always felt more of a comfort really instead of being sad. It makes me feel like I\'m not alone in feeling this way, that some other lost soul out there knows and has gone through what I am going through.

People hold the belief that aiming for perfection allows them to be efficient, organized, and prepared. However, perfectionism can have the opposite effect. Perfectionism is a paradox. As one’s perfectionism increases, they are most likely to feel frustrated and upset rather than fulfilled. \xa0Setting high expectations can be motivating and quite healthy. However, when taken to the extreme, our productivity can actually decrease. Perfectionists frequently experience many of the symptoms listed below:\n\nFear of failure.\xa0Perfectionists often equate failure to achieve their goals with a lack of personal worth or value.\n\nFear of making mistakes.\xa0Perfectionists often equate mistakes with failure. In orienting their lives around avoiding mistakes, perfectionists miss opportunities to learn and grow.\n\nFear of disapproval.\xa0If they let others see their flaws, perfectionists often fear that they will no longer be accepted. Trying to be perfect is a way of trying to protect themselves from criticism, rejection, and disapproval.\n\nAll-or-none thinking.\xa0Perfectionists frequently believe that they are worthless if their accomplishments are not perfect. Perfectionists have difficulty seeing situations in perspective. For example, a “straight A” student who receives a “B” might believe, “I am a total failure.”\n\nOvercompensating.\xa0Performing a behavior in an excessive manner to try to ensure nothing goes wrong\n\nExcessive Checking and Reassurance Seeking.\xa0Checking and/or seeking reassurance from others that a task has been done well enough or that all standards are met\n\nExcessive Organizing and List Making.\xa0Spending so much time getting organized that it interfere with getting tasks completed\n\nProcrastination:\xa0Putting off doing things for fear of not meeting standards\n\nAvoidance.\xa0Avoiding doing something altogether for fear of not meeting standards.', ""Madonna is the Queen of Pop, there was Nobody like Madonna before there was Madonna.\nAriana is the best I've seen since.

Él sufrió en su lugar, como su Sustituto, y resucitó después de tres días, ahora está sentado a la diestra del Padre. \r\n\r\nSi quiere ser salvo de la ira de Dios en el día del juicio, tiene que hacer dos cosas…\r\n\r\nArrepentirse. Tiene que confesar que ha pecado contra Dios, juez justo y recto. Para “convertirse a” Cristo, tiene que “convertirse de” sus pecados.\r\n\r\n “Pero Dios, habiendo pasado por alto los tiempos de esta ignorancia, ahora manda a todos los hombres en todo lugar, que se arrepientan; por cuanto ha establecido un día en el cual juzgará al mundo con justicia, por aquel varón a quien designó, dando fe a todos con haberle levantado de los muertos”. (Hechos 17:30-31)\r\n\r\nPoner su fe en el Señor. Tiene que poner su completa confianza para la salvación para la Persona y la obra del Señor Jesucristo. Esto quiere decir que tiene confiar en Él como confiaría en un paracaídas si tuviera que lanzarse de un avión. Él es su única esperanza.\r\n\r\n“La justicia de Dios por medio de la fe en Jesucristo, para todos los que creen en él. Porque no hay diferencia,  por cuanto todos pecaron, y están destituidos de la gloria de Dios” (Romanos 3:21-23) \r\n\r\n“Porque por gracia sois salvos por medio de la fe; y esto no de vosotros, pues es don de Dios; no por obras, para que nadie se gloríe.” (Efesios 2:8-9)\r\n\r\n¡¡Que Dios les bendiga!! :))', 'What is this??', 'Ankit priya ghansela']"

1868,ZGjnklNv5po,"[""Oink Oink.. I am looking at the Many Bottles.. the empty bottles are on the sands.. and I am trying to look for One.. if there is a Note written back to Me.. so many empty bottles are laying all around.. hoping that YOU have received the Message in the Bottle.. the Letter.. the Love Letter I wrote to YOU when I was in the Room.. sitting by the desk.. I would be looking at Your Picture.. for the first time in my life.. I have never felt the way I do now.. waiting for YOU by the Beach.. so many days passed by.. which became weeks down the Line.. and Now.. I been waiting for Your Answer.. hoping that YOU wrote me something back.. as I am standing around.. the Last time I came to this same beach.. Not even ONE bottle.. an empty Bottle was here.. but at this very Night.. there are just too many empty bottles laying around.. which I am thinking.. at least there must be One.. but My Heart would sank as I would be looking at each empty Bottle.. I don't see any of it with any notes or Letters coming back.. I feel so Sad.. maybe the Bottle.. the Love Letter I wrote to YOU.. putting inside the empty Bottle.. I am feeling.. and losing hope.. what if the Message in the Bottle has went to the wrong location.. what if YOU have never received it.. maybe it is still in the Ocean Waters floating through the Water.. unable to reach YOU.. what if it went to the Other side.. to someone else who I never wrote too.. I am just confused at this Point because I have written the Letter.. Love Letter to YOU.. I even looked UP to the Sky.. I looked at the MOON.. asking in prayers to guide the Message in the Bottle.. if that MOON has an ear.. and able to hear my voice and can listen to my words.. would IT help to guide the Message in the Bottle and send it to Your direction.. I would  ask.. will you please Help me.. because YOU know that I am in love.. I want to share this open Heart.. My Heart has been opened to share and to tell YOU what is in me.. hoping that YOU feel the same as what I feel right NOW.. I been looking UP to the Moon.. asking.. Looking at it.. I would say to the MOON.. would you lend me Your Hand.. if YOU have a Hand.. If YOU have an ear.. can YOU please listen to my words.. Can you hear my voice because I really Need something from YOU.. it is YOUR Help.. as YOU can see.. I have written a Letter.. a Love Letter and I have PUT the Letter.. rolled into and put into this An Empty Bottle and I would show the MOON.. the Empty Bottle.. Love Letter rolled up and stick it into the An empty Bottle and I would walk up closer to the waves of Water coming into the Beach sand and I would toss the Message in the Bottle IN to the Water.. as I would stand still in the Night.. I would LOOK UP to the MOON.. finger pointing to the Message in the Bottle.. IF you can hear me this very night.. If YOU can hear my Voice.. if you hear my words.. Please do me a favor.. Guide that Message IN the Bottle.. Please.. Help that Message in the Bottle to travel to the right Place.. and I have a Picture of YOU and I would pull it out and I would SHOW the Face.. the Picture of YOU up to the MOON.. if you have eyes.. Please Open Your eyes wide and take a LOOK.. take a good Look of this Picture.. I am asking YOU.. LOOKING UP to the MOON.. I am asking YOU.. this Message in the Bottle belongs TO the One I am showing you the Picture.. Please Help me.. guide it through so it can go carefully to the right person which is YOU.. It took me a long hours of thinking.. picking UP a Pencil.. finding a clean sheet of Paper.. trying to brain storm at first.. trying to find the right words to write.. thinking over and over what to write.. as I would be staring at the Blank Sheet of Paper.. I would sit alone.. but cannot put the Words to write on that Blank sheet piece of Paper.. I would sit alone by the desk.. trying to pick and choose the right Words to share from my Heart.. ideas would Not come so fast and I had to write and stop.. try to write again and I would stop.. I would be angry with myself because I would write on that Clean Blank sheet of paper.. I would try to read it.. re read it over and over.. did NOT sound right.. grab the paper which been written and I would roll into the Ball with that Paper and toss it into the Trash can in the room.. I would be struggling through the Night.. struggling with Hours what to write.. as I would look at the Time.. looking at the watch in the room.. only thing I see is the TIME ticks so fast.. One hour goes by.. another clean blank sheet of paper I would pull out to write YOU.. a Letter.. a Love Letter.. only thing that I can think in that night is the TIME.. the Time flies so fast.. but I am sitting alone by the desk.. Unable to fulfill what I wanted to do by telling YOU.. sharing YOU.. writing YOU.. the first three letter Hits and I would write.. I LOVE YOU.. and trying to fill in the Blank.. asking myself.. what am I doing.. so much time is passing BY.. making my Heart to skip.. making it skip twice and three times.. because only the Three Letter words I am able to tell YOU and Nothing More.. am I getting Old.. am I losing memories.. what is happening to myself.. and I would open the Bottle.. and starts to Pour into the Shot Glass.. as I place the Bottle Down.. I would pick up the shot Glass and take a Shot.. I want to cry because I know there are so much words I want to say to YOU.. I wanted to tell YOU so much but.. sitting by the desk Alone for about the Hour that went by.. I feel like I just can't write.. I can't write but My Heart has so much to say.. because I know that deep inside.. I love YOU.. I would grab the Bottle and pour more into the Shot Glass.. putting the Bottle Down.. grabbing the Shot Glass.. I open my mouth and take a shot.. slamming into me.. I feel so stressful now.. I want to tell YOU.. but what am I suppose to say.. I can't just put I love YOU on this Big Pieces of Blank Paper.. I know that I needs to fill in the Blank as much as Possible so that YOU Know my Heart.. I want to tell YOU.. I want to tell YOU MORE.. I just don't want to say three little words and put the period at the end.. I want to tell you much more than Just the three words I love YOU or I miss YOU.. just too vague and makes me feel like I have NO words to say.. and I turn around.. LOOKING behind me is the Bed.. and there is something that is sitting on the TOP of the Bed.. it is the Giant Teddy Bear.. and Next to the Giant Teddy Bear is the Pillow.. the shape of the Heart color Pink.. before I would turn to look back again to look.. I would pull the Picture of YOU.. and Place it right next to the Blank Sheet piece of Paper.. and I would take a closer LOOK at your Picture and my words would say looking at your picture.. why do I keep on missing YOU.. why do I keep on looking at your Picture.. why can I just stop everything.. it would not hurt me this Much.. the pain and the ache of Missing YOU.. the More I miss YOU the more I think of YOU.. the More I think of YOU.. I just want to say.. to tell YOU that I love YOU.. I would turn around to look back again.. the Wall and the bed next to the Wall.. the Giant Teddy Bear sitting on the TOP of the Bed.. I would close Both eyes and tried to imagine.. tries to envision YOU sitting on the TOP of the Bed and your Arms.. arms.. YOUR arms Holding.. wrapping around the Giant Teddy Bear.. I open both eyes.. Are you there.. I am trying to ask if I see YOU.. are you there yet.. and I can feel my Heart.. so I turn around.. facing the Piece of paper.. my hand grabs the Pencil and I start to write YOU a letter.. a Love Letter that only can comes from My Heart.. can I feel my Heart crying.. can I feel my eyes wants to shed some tears because I begin to write.. I see my hand.. as the pencil starts to write on the Paper.. I would tell YOU.. I am missing YOU.. and YOU have left behind the GIANT TEDDY BEAR.. many nights when I sit alone and I would be sitting by the Desk.. I would turn to look back.. it is the Giant Teddy Bear which brings so much memories to me.. even though for the Hour went by.. I sat alone.. could not put any words on the Pieces of Paper.. only thing is that My Hand grabs and holds unto the pencil tightly.. I would tell my hand to write.. I want to see the Words written on the Paper.. but it is My Brain.. the thought stops and locks up.. even though my hand wants to move and to write.. My thoughts seems like it just wants to stop.. holding it still.. even though I feel it in my heart and has so much to say to YOU.. I wonder why I can't write on this Very night.. I would open the Bottle of a Whiskey I bought and started to pour on the shot glass.. the pain and the ache in my Heart and my soul.. just killing me because I miss YOU so Much and only words that was stuck and has been written was the three letter words.. I love YOU.. I wanted to scream.. I wanted to cry because I know that in my Heart.. I needs to say something.. I needs to tell YOU what is really going on in me.. to tell YOU that I love YOU and how much I miss YOU.. when I started to take some more Shot from the Shot glass.. I started to Miss YOU.. all over again I started to miss YOU more as I would pour and taking shot from the Whiskey Bottle.. as I would watch the Bottle being emptied.. missing YOU started to Hurt me more.. as I would pull out and place Your Picture in front of Me.. as I would look at YOU through this Picture.. two lines of tears.. tear drops starts to run down my eyes because I wanted to be with YOU.. just missing YOU and unable to do anything.. that is when I turn to LOOK back.. I wanted to see YOU.. I wanted YOU to be there.. Your Presences.. even I turn to LOOK back.. I found nothing but the Giant Teddy Bear sitting alone.. just like me sitting here alone.. I even had to try to close.. I even closed my both eyes because I wanted to see YOU.."", ""Oink Oink.. I am sitting by the desk.. I am looking at the shot glass.. and grabbed the Bottle of whiskey and poured into the Shot glass.. placing the whiskey down.. picked up the shot glass.. opened my mouth and take a shot.. I am trying to forget YOU.. but I just can't.. I have placed your picture on the top of the desk.. I keep on looking at this picture.. I tell myself I needs to stop.. but I feel like I needs to keep on looking.. I would look at your picture and say.. why are you doing this to me.. why do I have to keep on looking at you.. of course I have a pencil and a clean white sheet of paper.. I want to draw.. looking at your picture.. I want to draw the picture of you.. but I know that I am not that good in drawing at all.. but I can feel.. this whiskey starts to kick my head.. I feel light headed and buzzing.. I know I drank so that I can forget you.. but why is it that I am missing you more now.. I just can't take my eyes off of you.. as I am looking at your picture.. why can't your picture talk back to me.. I want to hear something from you.. but no matter how many times I am going to tell you looking at your picture.. I will not hear anything from the Other side.. but I want to hear from you.. Please.. tell me something so that I don't feel the light headed I am feeling at this point right now.. YOU know that I love you.. I can tell you many times that I love YOU.. can you tell me something.. can you hear me say the words to YOU.. I love you.. and I grab the pencil.. starts to trace and starts to draw.. of course I am looking at your picture.. as I stopped.. putting the pencil down.. I have drawn a picture of a Heart.. I know that I am missing your Heart.. and I am looking at this pieces of paper.. looking at the Heart.. this is suppose to be your Heart.. so that I can touch it.. as my hand touches the paper.. my hand touch the Heart.. can you feel my hand.. I am touching your Heart.. can you please tell me that you can feel my Hand touching your Hand.. as my eyes would look at the picture.. it is YOUR Heart I drew.. maybe you would tell me that Heart does not look like yours at all.. I told you that I am not an artist who can paint or draw pictures.. but I know that I can try to draw a Heart.. it is only Your Heart I want to draw.. I want to touch your Heart too.. How about me write my Name on this Heart.. and can I take this piece of paper and give it to YOU.. telling you that I have wrote my name so that YOU know that it is me who loves YOU and asking you to remember my Name.. so that you know that I love you.. I belong to YOU only.. so please.. tell me that I can.. as I grab the bottle of whiskey and pour into the shot Glass.. and place the bottle of whiskey on the top of the desk.. I grab the shot glass and open my mouth and take a shot.. I can feel it burning.. it feels like it wants to burn my Heart instead.. why.. I don't know.. you tell me why.. because I want to hear from you saying that I am allowed too.. as I am sitting down.. looking at the piece of paper.. looking at the Heart I drew.. I turn to look at your picture.. and I would hear a Crying.. I am wondering.. who is crying at this time of night.. is it my Heart.. is My Heart crying from the inside.. is it because of the whiskey.. the shot glass.. the shot of this whiskey.. I don't think my Heart would cry because of it.. and I would sit still.. maybe it is this Heart.. the Heart I drew.. which it is suppose to be Your Heart.. so is Your Heart crying.. and I would sit still trying to figure out why I am hearing crying.. and the Cry I am comes behind me.. and I would turn to look back.. and when I turn to look back.. I see a Teddy Bear.. the arms are stretching out.. and keeps on crying.. and I am wondering.. when did this Teddy Bear got here.. it is smaller and wearing a blue shirt.. must be.. and I would stand up from the chair.. and I hear from the Teddy Bear crying.. MOMMA.. and I stop.. I just can't.. I see tears in the eyes of this Baby Teddy Bear.. and He is crying for Momma.. and I am thinking.. why are you asking me for MOMMA.. I am trying to get over and I grab the Picture and I walk to the bed.. the Baby Teddy Bear sitting on the top of the bed.. and I would sit next to the Baby Teddy Bear and I show the picture.. and I would point.. is this Your MOMMA and the Baby Teddy Bear head goes UP and down telling me that YOU are.. I am wondering.. I am trying to get.. How come now.. and the Baby Teddy Bear wraps the arms around your Picture.. I think you must be a Son.. I am very confused.. so YOU are looking for Momma and the Baby Teddy Bear cries and cries and cries looking for YOU.. and I am sitting down.. what am I suppose to do.. and I start to feel my tears running down.. if you keep on crying.. how about me.. you are going to make me cry with you and I would grab the Picture.. I want you to let go so that YOU don't cry no more and I pull the picture away from the Baby Teddy Bear.. I hear the cry getting louder and louder.. I would get up from sitting on top of the bed.. I would be walking and I stop.. I turn to look back.. the baby Teddy Bear keeps crying and crying.. arms are stretching out.. CRYING FOR MOMMA.. what am I suppose to do.. I do not think your Momma is here.. I am here on my own.. and I just stand there.. I am looking at your picture.. I can't stop my tears running down.. I am here looking at your picture.. wanting to talk to you and wanting to hear from you.. I don't even know where you are.. there is a baby Teddy Bear.. a Son.. who is crying for YOU.. asking me where is MOMMA.. how am I suppose to answer the Baby Teddy Bear's question.. I want to know where YOU are.. but only thing I have is your picture.. I want to hear from you as much as this SON in the room.. crying and crying.. I thought that something was wrong with me.. I thought that My Heart was crying.. crying because I miss YOU.. that I love YOU.. that I want to see YOU and that I want to be close to YOU.. I heard this cry.. but it is Loud cry.. and I turn to look at the bed.. the baby Teddy Bear looks at me.. and I see the tears keeps on dropping.. wetting the bed.. and starts to cry and cry.. I am getting more emotional.. I am trying to get drunk.. but this Baby Teddy Bear is not helping me at at.. and I go over to the Bed and I sit.. I show the Baby Teddy Bear.. this Picture.. is it your Momma and the head moves up and down.. and I give the baby Teddy Bear the picture.. He wraps his arms around your picture and says MOMMA.. and I ask him.. where is your Momma.. please tell me.. and I would say.. I will take you to her.. I would wrap my arms around the baby Teddy Bear and I would lift him up and I get up out of the bed.. Tell me where is Your Momma.. so I can take you to her.. the Baby Teddy bear does not answer.. and I would walk out of the room.. and I am walking down the hall way and I stop.. I see you Holding the Other Teddy Bear.. the Daughter and I see you turn around and you looking at me.. and I am holding the Baby Teddy Bear.. my arms wrapped around.. and I look at you.. I think you have left this.. He is looking for Momma..  and I would see you placing the Other Teddy Bear.. wearing a pink shirt.. and she starts to cry..

I want to hold YOU like the way I am holding this Giant Teddy Bear.. it does not feel the same because I want it to be YOU instead.. I want YOU to be here with Me.. it is Hard to be in a place where I can't be with YOU..

I want to listen to your Heart beating.. so that I know I am hearing that YOU are alive.. that I know that YOU will never let Other men get close to Your Heart.. so that I want to be the One who can get close to Your Heart.. as My both arms opens wide and the Giant Teddy Bear is release from holding.. I want YOU.. why can't it be YOU.. I am so tired of holding this Giant Teddy Bear because NO matter How many times I would hold it.. I know it is Not YOU.. I want it to be YOU.. forever in my arms and when YOU are able to get close to me.. I want to tell Your ears.. I love YOU.. I would say.. and whisper.. I love YOU and my arms will never let YOU go.. so please be close.. and as I would lay back down.. and On the Pillow.. I would close both eyes.. trying to get some rest.. trying to get some sleep.. my eyes would close.. close tight then it opens.. and I am looking UP.. and I see YOUR beautiful Face.. I see your Beautiful smile.. looking at the ceiling.. I must be going crazy.. am I going mad or crazy.. I am seeing YOU up on that ceiling.. but I am trying to get some rest.. wanting to sleep.. I just can't let YOU go.. I can't even think right.. I am seeing YOU everywhere.. let me please love YOU then.. If I can't let you go.. then Please.. let me love YOU.. I want to love YOU.. and I want to tell YOU how much I love YOU.. since I can't ever get rid of YOU and I keep on seeing YOU everywhere.. then.. tell me How can I reach YOU.. how can I get close to YOU so that I can tell YOU and show YOU how much I love YOU.. since I see You when I close both eyes.. and when I open both eyes.. I am looking at the ceiling.. I still see YOU.. if I sit up and go to the desk sitting on the chair.. I have your picture there.. I will see you there again.. NO matter How I am trying to escape..  I keep on seeing YOU.. Now Holding this Giant Teddy Bear in my arms.. I am holding thinking of YOU.. that I rather want it to be YOU.. and I know that it is not YOU.. it hurts me.. keep longing and longing.. this yearning of Not able to be with YOU kills me inside.. because I know I want to be with YOU.. as I sit UP.. and I would get out of the bed.. Out of the room I go to the rest room.. turning on the light and on the Bottom corner.. I remember I have put Your Picture there too.. which I would look down on the corner.. I see Your Picture.. the water runs down.. I am washing my face with both hands.. I just can't go to sleep.. I am trying to get you off my Mind.. but the More I try too escape and get rid of YOU.. something is driving me crazy because I can't escape YOU.. my hand grabs the bottom corner and my hand grabs the picture.. what am I suppose to do now.. I am seeing YOUR picture here.. It is driving me Craze like I am insane.. must be that I must love YOU a lot.. because I have forgotten that I put your Picture here.. I would put your Picture down.. YOU are so Beautiful.. that it drives me crazy because YOU are so Beautiful.. as I am looking at myself.. looking at the Mirror.. I would say.. what are you doing to Me.. I wish I had answer.. maybe a solution.. but right Now I just can't figure OUT what do I do.. there is Nothing I can do at this point.. then tell me.. how do I get to YOU.. How do I get close to YOU.. tell me how so that I can tell you My Heart.. at least tell me where can I find Your Heart.. if I can't get to YOU.. let me please speak to your Heart.. let me please have your Heart.. then I know for sure there is a chance.. that there is an assurance that some day.. One day I am able to get close to YOU.. because this situation I am in is taking me NO where.. I am going insane.. it is driving me crazy.. I been holding that Giant Teddy Bear.. and I don't want to hold that Giant Teddy Bear any more because I want YOU more.. I want YOU instead.. but holding that Giant Teddy Bear only reminds me that I am going crazy.. because I wish.. I am wanting.. Please Help Me.. tell me and show me something.. Please give me an answer so that I know which way to YOU.. I need Your Love.. I need Your Heart.. I need YOU close.. I need you in my arms instead.. and It is killing me that YOU are so far.. that there is a long distance between us.. at least show me that YOU know where Your Heart is.. show me Your Heart.. tell me your Heart because I need to Know..

YOU have left something behind and I am asking does it belongs to YOU.. and If you are over there on the Other side struggling for what YOU have lost.. DID you lost a Pillow.. a Heart shape color Pink.. I have it over here.. my arms around the Shape Heart Pink Pillow.. I wanted to ask YOU.. why did you leave it behind.. WHY did you lose this Heart.. DID you left it behind or did you lost it on your way going somewhere because I have it with Me.. Please tell me that I can have the Heart.. Can We make a trade when YOU see me soon.. if you come to see me.. can we trade Heart to Heart.. I will give YOU this Pillow.. shape of a Heart color Pink and YOU can give me your Real Heart..

I know that without YOU.. my life is going to be incomplete.. that is why I need you.. I want you near me but only way is to Love your Heart.. What do I must do to get to Your Heart.. I been asking you for a while.. but YOU have never given me a straight Answer.. I am only asking for just one thing.. it is Your Real Heart.. Not a Pillow.. Not a Shape of a Heart.. Not a Color Pink either.. but Your Real Heart.. and as I stand Looking UP at the Moon.. my arms around the Shape Heart.. color Pink pillow.. I wish that it was the real Heart.. at least I can say something to the Real Heart.. what can I do with this Pillow.. shape of a Heart.. No matter how much I say to this Pillow.. it only wants me to lay my Head down on it.. If I lay down.. at least I want to hear the sound.. the beating.. I want to hear it.. listen to your Heart Beat and I would turn to Your Heart as I be listening to the sound and the beating of the Heart.. LOOKING at your Heart.. I would say.. I love YOU.. DO you love me too.. I would turn again to your Heart and I will say.. I love YOU.. Do you love me too.. can YOU please tell me that YOU can love me too.. because YOU know how much I love you.. I have been waiting for this for a long.. to tell you but also to hear from you if YOU DO.. and can I please turn to Your Heart and tell your Heart my words.. that I love you.. as I would step few steps back.. I would think about before I came out to the Patio.. I was sitting on the top of the Bed and as I lay on the Bed.. something laying beside me.. and I turn to face.. the Shape of the Heart.. color Pink.. the Pillow is next to me.. and I would sit UP on the bed.. I have the phone with me.. and I hit to see the Picture.. many pictures I have saved and there is One Picture.. as I would take a LOOK at the Picture.. it is you on this bed.. I have taken a picture of you.. you were laying on the side.. holding your arms around this Pillow.. the shape of the Heart.. the color Pink.. and both of your eyes were closed.. that means you were sleeping and I have taken a picture of you while you were falling asleep.. Like a Sleeping Beauty.. in such a peace and beauty you were.. as I am sitting on the bed.. I see the same Pillow.. the shape of the Heart.. the color Pink.. and I am wondering.. why is this here.. I know that this is Yours.. why did you leave it on this Bed.. I never bought a Pillow.. shape of a Heart.. color Pink.. but it was laying.. I tried to go to sleep but while trying to lay on my side.. I was faced with this Heart shape Pillow.. color Pink and it woke Me up.. and I have forgotten that it was here or thought that It was taken with YOU.. as I was sitting on the Top of the Bed.. I would be looking at it.. and I wanted to try what YOU have shown me in this Picture.. my hands grab this Heart shape Pillow.. color Pink.. my arms would go around and I would hold it tightly and lightly squeeze it.. Does your Heart feels this Way.. is it this Soft.. and is it this warm.. I love a Heart being warm and soft.. makes me want to hold It close and make you feel how I feel the way I feel when I hold and it is your Heart.. as I am holding.. my arms around the Heart shape Pillow.. color Pink.. I start to think of you more.. wondering DO you miss Me.. because right Now.. holding this Heart shape Pillow.. the color Pink.. I am missing YOU.. Now I want to see YOU.. I want to see you near and close to Me.. but being so Far.. I just feel like I just can't do anything.. why do I must feel this Way that there is Nothing I can do even though it is just loving YOU.. why can't I love you close.. Why can't you be here.. be near me so I can love you closer.. why do YOU have to be so far that sometimes I feel like I can't love you the way I want to because of the distance between.. I want you close. I want you near.. Please come closer.. and I would be so sad.. as I am looking at the Picture.. on the Phone.. there is the Picture of YOU holding the Heart shape Pillow.. and YOU look in such peace.. as I am looking at the picture of YOU.. I am sitting on the Top of the Bed.. Holding the same Pillow.. Shape of the Heart.. color Pink.. Does it feels the same.. I think looking at the Picture.. looking at you holding the same Heart Shape Pillow.. the Color Pink.. I can feel Your Heart.. I guess knowing that we can share something very special feeling of loving the Shape Heart.. because I am thinking of it being YOUR HEART.. only YOUR Heart I want to hold.. Only Your Heart I want to love and tell it that I love YOU.. as I am holding with both arms around It.. I know this has to be the same feelings.. that it is all about loving YOU.. I am looking at the Picture of YOU.. Do you know that I am holding a Heart.. it is a Shape of A Heart.. I am thinking of being Your Heart to me.. because I want to hold your Heart the way I am holding this Shape Heart.. the Pillow.. only if you did Not go and you were to stay here.. I wonder How you would react.. I wonder what would you have done.. coming over.. and YOU be seeing this Shape Heart of the Pillow.. the Pink Color on the top of"", 'The new princess  of pop ❤️❤️❤️', 'Better than the original!!!']"

I am looking at the waters.. watching the waves coming in.. I am looking Up at the Moon.. asking when will I see YOU.. I have come to this Beach.. and I left for awhile.. the last time I came.. I brought a Bottle.. and sat on a Big rock.. bringing a Shot Glass and having Your Picture in my hand.. Looking at YOU through the Picture.. missing YOU.. and I would take Shot after another Shot.. as I would look at your Picture.. I would open my mouth.. taking to the Picture.. but NO matter how much words I would say looking at your Picture.. I don't hear anything on the Other side.. I remember before I came to this Beach.. I was at Home.. sitting on the desk.. and decided to pick UP a pen and looking at a piece of paper.. I started to write YOU something on the Piece of paper and it became a Written letter I wrote from My Heart.. asking YOU.. Pleading for YOU.. telling How much I missed YOU.. and I would write about the daily days that was happening around me and asking if YOU can Come.. because I know that If I don't ask YOU.. YOU are Not going to know anything at All.. so I have decided to write on a piece of paper.. telling YOU how much I love YOU.. How much YOU means to me.. that YOU means everything to Me.. and that I want to see YOU.. be close to YOU and wants to wrap my arms around YOU and hold YOU close in my arms and whisper into your ears.. that I love YOU.. just sitting down by the desk.. and just can't stop thinking about YOU.. that I wanted to be with YOU for ever and that when YOU come.. I will never let YOU go.. I will not these arms let go of YOU because I have been sitting here.. standing here missing YOU.. waiting for YOU.. longing for YOU.. waiting for YOU and longing all over again because I just can't stop think of YOU.. How much I love YOU.. that it kills me that I can't be close.. it kills me inside that why you have to be gone for so Long.. and that no matter what.. I be here waiting for YOU till you come.. I even wrote on the Piece of paper.. my love Letter that I am standing by this One Beach and I gave the address where the Beach is at and that I am going to bring a Bottle.. and with me is a Piece of Paper which I wrote to you.. a Love that comes from my Heart and On this Beach.. I am going to put the Piece of Paper.. My Love Letter inside the Bottle and I am going to toss it into the waters and let the Message in the Bottle goes to YOU.. and I know.. I believe that if it means meant to be for Us.. I know that Some way and Some How it will go to where you at and YOU are able to receive this Letter.. a Message in the Bottle.. the Piece of paper I wrote.. I hope that it is able to get to you.. Now I am here at the beach.. standing here on the Other side.. I am looking at the waters.. it has been few weeks that has passed by.. If you are wondering why has it taken me this long to come back to this Beach.. It is because I know that it is going to take time for the Message in the Bottle be delivered to YOU.. I had to wait for a while.. it was hard waiting by my House.. as I would stand Out side.. every night I would come OUT from my house and I would turn to face the Moon.. and I am wondering is it the time for me to GO to that Beach.. and I would be looking at the Moon.. asking over and over.. I would not hear.. there would be NO answer I hear as I would stand out side by the House.. so I would tell myself.. it must not be right now.. so I would go back inside the House.. and would wait for the Next day.. waiting for the Sun to go down and I would wait till the Moon comes UP.. walking out the Front door.. I would turn to face the Moon and be asking the same Question.. every New Day.. I wait for the Night to rise.. looking for the MOON to show UP before my eyes and I would wait.. some nights I would not see the MOON at all.. so I would just go back inside the House.. just waiting for the Next Night.. waiting for the Moon to show UP.. too appear before my eyes.. and I would turn to look at that Moon.. asking.. finally weeks would pass by.. and I do not hear any answers from that same Moon.. maybe it does not hear me.. or does Not even know what is going on.. that Moon never tells me anything.. but it does show up many Nights and appears before my eyes.. I get tired of hearing.. I get tired of hearing no answers so I have finally told myself.. May be this is the very Night.. and I would drive in the car.. coming to the same Beach.. and I would walk on the sand and I would see the Big Rock.. Looking at How I was hurt.. I was drinking.. taking shots.. looking at your Picture.. the Piece of paper in my pocket.. I was hurt.. with a Pain and Heart ache.. It was my birthday.. and I wanted YOU to celebrate with me.. but How can YOU celebrate with me if YOU are gone.. YOU are far away and I started to take shots.. I would be looking Up.. LOOKING at the MOON.. shouting and screaming.. crying and balling.. tears kept on dropping.. Just missing YOU.. wanting to see YOU so bad.. Missing you Hard.. Missing you that I just had to let out.. pouring out my tears.. and I would look at the Bottle.. and it was empty.. I dropped the shot glass on the sand.. and In the pocket I pulled OUT the piece of paper.. the Written.. I wrote you a Love Letter on this Piece of Paper and I would fold to roll it UP and put into the Bottle.. and I would LOOK at the waters.. waves coming in and leaving.. I would walk up and I am looking at the Bottle.. inside is the Message I wrote to YOU and I yelled Out loud.. saying I miss YOU.. and Yelling Out Loud.. I love YOU and throw the Bottle into the Waters.. and I just sat on the sand.. looking at the Bottle.. the water waves hitting it and I don't see it no more.. and I am sitting on the sand crying.. I wish that the Bottle gets to YOU.. I have wrote you something.. I hope that the waters can help it to get across to YOU.. As I am standing here.. I am thinking of when I was here like few weeks ago.. the same spot which I was drunk.. and I was crying.. watching the waves and the Bottle in the waters.. I am here wondering if YOU have received the Message in the Bottle.. How do I know if it will get to YOU.. but I know that I have written a Letter to YOU.. what if it is Not you who grabs the Message in the Bottle but I don't want it to be in someone else's hands.. because I have written on that piece of Paper to YOU.. as I am standing here at Night.. I look UP.. I see the MOON.. it looks so Big this very night and yes.. I have been waiting now for weeks.. did YOU received the Message in the Bottle.. I know that by Faith.. I do believe in love.. and loving YOU is who I believe it is to be true.. I know that I can wait for YOU.. No matter How far.. or How many bottles I needs to drink UP.. or HOW many pieces of papers I needs to write and to tell YOU in many little words.. I can always wait for YOU till you are ready for Me.. there is NO problem for me to wait because I know I love YOU.. I just don't want my Words get to you become empty words.. it is words that I am speaking and telling YOU through writing because this is the Only way I can get across to YOU.. I wish there are some other way but this is the Only way I can get YOU across my Mind.. I tell you my Heart.. I tell you from the deeper side of My Heart because I love YOU.. but I am standing here on the Beach.. I wish that the message got to YOU.. I will come back to this Beach Soon because I am going to bring YOU another Letter.. a Piece of paper written as my Love Letter.. that is the Only way I can tell YOU.. express my Heart and feelings.. all my emotions how much I love YOU.. but it seems like that YOU have Not received the Message Yet.. but what if YOU did receive it.. are you going to send me a Message in the Bottle to let me know YOU have read the written.. the Piece of Paper I wrote to YOU of How much I miss YOU.. How much I love YOU.. are you going to show UP next time I come here.. because that be the greatest answer you can give me.. if YOU are not sure.. I know that I can truly wait.. wait for YOU until you are sure.. Until you are ready for me to Love YOU.. YOU do not have to do anything because it is ME who loves YOU first.. I have never stopped loving YOU.. and I told you many times that I can keep on loving YOU.. as long as YOU show UP and Open your Heart to me.. YOU are wondering what do YOU needs to do.. I will tell you this simple.. NOTHING.. I am not asking YOU for anything but for YOU to get ready to receive all my Love.. all I can do is Love YOU.. what more can I do or say but to tell YOU that I love YOU.. as I am standing here.. I am looking at the MOON.. it is staring over Me.. and I am looking at that MOON.. I can see tears falling from the MOON.. am I just tired.. because it is very late in the Night.. Must be that my eyes are getting tired because I am watching the MOON showing me tears.. I hope that if you are close by a Beach.. and if it is at Night.. walk on the sand and what I am seeing right Now is that the MOON is crying before my eyes.. if you are able to see that Same Moon.. you can see what I am seeing that it is My Heart who is crying for YOU.. reflection comes from that MOON because I truly believe that MOON knows my Heart.. that MOON has seen me many nights.. I would show UP.. I would walk out side from my House.. I would turn to face that MOON and I am sure it does not forget my Face.. the few weeks back.. that MOON appeared before Me.. that Moon saw me sitting on the Big Rock.. saw me looking at Your Picture.. I was taking shots from the Bottle.. and Saw me putting a Letter.. piece of paper rolled UP into the Bottle.. and saw Me Toss the message in the Bottle into the waters..

I have been waiting for this for a long.. to tell you but also to hear from you if YOU DO.. and can I please turn to Your Heart and tell your Heart my words.. that I love you.. as I would step few steps back.. I would think about before I came out to the Patio.. I was sitting on the top of the Bed and as I lay on the Bed.. something laying beside me.. and I turn to face.. the Shape of the Heart.. color Pink.. the Pillow is next to me.. and I would sit UP on the bed.. I have the phone with me.. and I hit to see the Picture.. many pictures I have saved and there is One Picture.. as I would take a LOOK at the Picture.. it is you on this bed.. I have taken a picture of you.. you were laying on the side.. holding your arms around this Pillow.. the shape of the Heart.. the color Pink.. and both of your eyes were closed.. that means you were sleeping and I have taken a picture of you while you were falling asleep.. Like a Sleeping Beauty.. in such a peace and beauty you were.. as I am sitting on the bed.. I see the same Pillow.. the shape of the Heart.. the color Pink.. and I am wondering.. why is this here.. I know that this is Yours.. why did you leave it on this Bed.. I never bought a Pillow.. shape of a Heart.. color Pink.. but it was laying.. I tried to go to sleep but while trying to lay on my side.. I was faced with this Heart shape Pillow.. color Pink and it woke Me up.. and I have forgotten that it was here or thought that It was taken with YOU.. as I was sitting on the Top of the Bed.. I would be looking at it.. and I wanted to try what YOU have shown me in this Picture.. my hands grab this Heart shape Pillow.. color Pink.. my arms would go around and I would hold it tightly and lightly squeeze it.. Does your Heart feels this Way.. is it this Soft.. and is it this warm.. I love a Heart being warm and soft.. makes me want to hold It close and make you feel how I feel the way I feel when I hold and it is your Heart.. as I am holding.. my arms around the Heart shape Pillow.. color Pink.. I start to think of you more.. wondering DO you miss Me.. because right Now.. holding this Heart shape Pillow.. the color Pink.. I am missing YOU.. Now I want to see YOU.. I want to see you near and close to Me.. but being so Far.. I just feel like I just can't do anything.. why do I must feel this Way that there is Nothing I can do even though it is just loving YOU.. why can't I love you close.. Why can't you be here.. be near me so I can love you closer.. why do YOU have to be so far that sometimes I feel like I can't love you the way I want to because of the distance between.. I want you close. I want you near.. Please come closer.. and I would be so sad.. as I am looking at the Picture.. on the Phone.. there is the Picture of YOU holding the Heart shape Pillow.. and YOU look in such peace.. as I am looking at the picture of YOU.. I am sitting on the Top of the Bed.. Holding the same Pillow.. Shape of the Heart.. color Pink.. Does it feels the same.. I think looking at the Picture.. looking at you holding the same Heart Shape Pillow.. the Color Pink.. I can feel Your Heart.. I guess knowing that we can share something very special feeling of loving the Shape Heart.. because I am thinking of it being YOUR HEART.. only YOUR Heart I want to hold.. Only Your Heart I want to love and tell it that I love YOU.. as I am holding with both arms around It.. I know this has to be the same feelings.. that it is all about loving YOU.. I am looking at the Picture of YOU.. Do you know that I am holding a Heart.. it is a Shape of A Heart.. I am thinking of being Your Heart to me.. because I want to hold your Heart the way I am holding this Shape Heart.. the Pillow.. only if you did Not go and you were to stay here..

I wonder what would you have done.. coming over.. and YOU be seeing this Shape Heart of the Pillow.. the Pink Color on the top of"", ""You know she's going to be a real legend if you hear her as a pro randomly saying 'CUT!'"", 'Laith Ashley is so hawwtt', 'You try your hardest you are amazing Taylor I love you you are amazing']"

I want Your Heart because I want YOU.. I need YOU.. Only YOU to be mine.. Please tell me that I can have this Heart.. Have your heart to be mine.. I am looking for Your Heart.. but.. tell me please.. where are YOU hiding Your Heart.. I need Your Heart.. so I know that one day.. YOU are able to love me Back.. But.. if YOU don't show me where YOU put your Heart.. How am I suppose to know.. as I am holding the Glass jar.. it is an Empty Glass Jar.. I am standing by the door.. I would knock on this door.. but I hear No response.. then why did YOU give me Your Picture.. YOU have left Your picture by my door.. I was about to go somewhere.. and when I open the door.. I looked down.. there is a Picture.. I picked it UP to take a look.. I saw YOU.. I just knew by looking at this Picture.. YOU are the one for me.. next to your picture there was an Empty Glass jar.. I have never asked for this Jar.. why would you leave it behind and right next to Your Picture.. did I asked for something.. did you heard my plea.. then why was this Glass jar.. empty glass jar left right with your Picture.. I took your picture and I looked in the back.. there was an address.. telling me to come to this place.. to this House.. to this door.. and that the note said.. YOU heard my voice.. so I know that YOU know what is my Heart.. you know that I been asking for YOU.. for long time I been asking.. but I have not got any response.. until this morning.. I was ready to walk.. but this picture with the empty Glass jar was left by my door.. finally YOU are telling me that I can come.. but.. DO you know that I am asking YOU for something.. I am asking for something more.. and I have brought this Empty Glass Jar.. here is Your Picture in my hands.. and Yes.. if YOU look back of the picture.. the direction how to get to this Place from where I was.. to show YOU proof that you have put this in the front door.. I am standing by this door.. I know that I can't get inside.. but.. tell me How to get inside.. the door does not open.. I am not sure if I can knock.. I did knock on this door but.. NO ONE answers.. I want YOU my love to answer this door.. I did not come here to find a stranger be opening this door.. so Please.. I have been knocking.. this door.. I knock with my hands but has no sounds.. what kind of door is this.. then How are you suppose to hear me that I am standing at the front of the door.. if I hear no sounds.. then YOU must not hear any sounds of knocking.. I been knocking.. what is this place.. it is a home I see.. and yes.. there is a door I am looking at.. but why doesn't it make any sounds.. a door must make a sound when knocking if it is made out of a woods.. but.. My hand keeps on knocking.. NO sounds.. I have never seen such a Door.. it looks like it is made of woods.. but where does the noise go if someone knocks.. but I hear no sounds.. and I would step back.. I look at the door and it changes.. so weird.. so strange.. it changes into a glass wall.. I am able to look through this glass wall.. and I am wondering.. what am I suppose to do.. I can see that this door is so Big.. the glass wall and able to see through.. it is a genius idea.. okay.. so are you able to hear me on the Other side.. can I knock on this Glass wall door.. if I knock.. does it make sounds.. can you please hear me.. I am asking you.. can YOU hear me.. and I am looking through the Glass wall door.. I have the Empty Glass jar.. with me is your Picture.. and I would step closer.. and I am looking around.. I can see something.. what is that inside this house.. LOOK and I can see a Beautiful Heart.. IT must be to the right place.. the right House.. I know this is Your Place know because I have been asking for Your Heart.. I see the Beautiful Heart.. SO pretty Pretty.. I want that Heart.. can I have that Heart.. I want Your Heart.. inside.. but this GLASS wall door does not Open for Me.. I see Your Heart.. and I have this Glass jar.. I want to take Your Heart home with me.. I need to have that Heart inside this house.. but the door does not open.. even though I knock.. I can knock thousand times.. it makes no sounds.. I hear nothing.. not even the knocking.. but that Heart.. LOOK.. I want that Beautiful Heart.. if I am unable to speak.. can I speak and YOU can hear Me.. if I say something and I would walk closer and the door comes back.. the Glass wall disappears and I can't see your Heart.. what happened.. I just saw the Beautiful Heart.. when I step closer.. I can't see.. but when I go back.. the Door opens and shows me the Glass wall of the door.. so what kind of place plays tricks with your mind.. but I want that Heart.. Your Heart is so beautiful.. I have come to this place.. but unwanted.. unable to get close to the Heart.. Please help me to find a way to get closer to your Heart.. I want to get close.. but How.. if I try to move and step closer.. the door reveals and tells me to stay away.. I can't see your Heart.. the door covers over.. then why would you put this empty glass jar.. and I am standing there.. Am I suppose to bring gifts.. am I suppose to find and bring flowers.. How about soft bears.. chocolate.. AM I SUPPOSE to put something into this Glass jar and show it to the Heart.. I wonder because this Glass jar is empty.. I did look at the Beautiful Heart.. the Heart knows.. the Heart sees what I bring.. maybe I am suppose to surprise Your Beautiful Heart.. what am I suppose to bring.. just empty.. I don't hear anything.. So I do turn around.. and I would walk off.. Since I know now there the House.. the Place.. I saw the Beautiful Heart.. I am going to come back.. I will return back to Your Heart.. I will return to let You know how much I want.. I need Your Heart.. I want to love YOU.. but how can I start loving YOU.. if I can't get to Your Heart.. that is why I want that Heart.. the Heart who is inside YOU.. that House.. behind the door.. Your Heart.. I saw Your Heart and Now I want it.. I need it.. I want Your Heart.. as I am in the room.. I am sitting on the desk.. just thinking about what to do.. what am I suppose to put into this Glass Jar.. what will grab Your Heart to know.. I want to grab Your Heart.. grab Your attention.. did not think that it be this Hard.. but of course.. I know that YOU Heart is precious.. Your Heart is special.. Your Heart is everything to Me.. and I want it.. I want that Heart.. I want all Your Heart.. so as I am looking at Your Picture..

I am sitting on the Floor.. there is this Album book.. full of pictures and I am flipping through One page at a time.. looking at the many pictures I have taken of YOU through the Years.. I am smiling as I am missing YOU.. I just came from the back yard.. and I just could not stand out there because I keep on missing YOU.. when you called me on the Phone.. hearing your voice.. I know that I could not tell you how much I loved You.. I know if I asked YOU now.. and what would you say to Me.. I think the time right now is Not.. I am waiting for the perfect timing to ask YOU.. and I would be struggling deep inside when would that time be.. what would happen if I asked YOU and YOU would say.. the Time is Not right.. maybe you are telling me YOU only like my friendship.. but what If I want more than just Your Friendship.. I want more.. I want Your Heart.. I would be looking at the Book of Album.. flipping to the next page.. all these pictures of YOU.. I have pasted so that I can see the different times of your many expressions.. some with a Big smile.. Others with a different smiles.. One or two with tears in your eyes.. and I am just looking.. thinking about the days.. thinking about those days when we use to smile a lot.. I am truly missing YOU right Now.. I keep on wanting to call YOU.. but I know that YOU are busy at this Point.. hearing your voice.. I want to call YOU so I can hear your voice again and I would try to dial but I would pause.. and I turn too look up.. and I see my Bed.. and I see the Pillow.. and I look at it.. did Not think about the Shape of this Pillow.. but.. is it a Heart.. I am wondering.. when did this Pillow came from.. I don't have a Pillow looking or having the Shape of this Heart.. and I am fond of the Shape.. does this means that this is How your Heart has its shape.. and I am wondering.. can I have this Shape of Heart.. I don't need this pillow.. what am I going to do with a Pillow that can not even make the sound of the Beating of your Heart.. I want this Shape of Heart.. not a Pillow but Your Heart.. and I look down looking at a Picture of YOU.. and I am wondering.. if YOU could hear me here in my room.. and I would open my Mouth.. can YOU Please hear me.. why did YOU have to go.. telling me YOU are going some where far and YOU are going on a vacation.. why did YOU not ask me if I wanted to come.. to join you on this vacation.. YOU know in a Heart beat I would gone with YOU.. when I flip the Next page.. and the pages down.. it is blank sheets.. there is NO more pictures after this One Page.. My eyes have stopped on this One Picture.. the Most favorite one.. with a Big Smile.. YOU are holding a Pillow.. the One that is a Shape of a Heart.. when I turn to look at the wall.. and next to the wall is my bed.. I see something that I have Not seen before.. I see a Pillow.. it is a Shape of the Heart.. color is Pink and Baby Blue.. I am looking at my bed.. the Heart shape pillow is sitting on top of the Bed.. Not sure if the Pillow can make the sound of the beating.. but seems like the Pillow Heart shape knows me.. I turn to look down at the Page.. I have pasted a Picture on this Sheet of Page with YOU.. YOU are smiling real big.. arms are holding and wrapping around this Pillow but has a Shape of a Heart.. I am wondering.. are you posing to show me that This is How your Heart looks.. why didn't you tell me that This is Your Heart.. I remember I walked in the room.. and YOU told me that YOU got something.. YOU would sit on the top of my bed and I remember clearly.. telling me to bring the Camera.. Of course I knew what YOU mean.. I left the room.. and Got the camera.. and walked back into the room.. YOU were smiling.. I have never seen such a Beautiful great smile.. and you will telling me to take a picture.. only I thought about at that time was just to take a Picture of YOU because I just love taking pictures when YOU smile.. makes my Stomach.. My Heart jumps with Joy inside when I see YOU smile.. I see the arms wrapping and pressing down on the Pillow.. the Heart shape.. I did not think much of it at that time because all YOU wanted was me to take picture of YOU.. I would press and it clicks few times.. Now.. I am looking at the Pictures.. there are few pictures of YOU holding.. arms wrapped around this Pillow.. of the Shape of a Heart.. I did not know you wanted to tell me something.. show me something.. Now I am noticing everything after YOU are gone.. YOU know that when YOU told me you are going on a long trip.. on a vacation.. I was waiting for YOU to ask me if I could go.. or was it me who was suppose to ask YOU if I was invited to go with YOU.. because I really wanted to go with YOU.. do YOU know why.. If I went with YOU.. I be bringing my Camera.. and I could of taken more pictures of YOU.. there are many empty spaces that needs to be covered by your pictures.. I want to cover this Whole Book Album with YOUR pictures.. think about many places where I can stop to take YOU more pictures.. and I could of collected all the pictures.. and Start too fill in the empty spaces of this Album of Your pictures.. Now.. I just have to wait for you to come back.. But How long will this trip be because I am missing YOU.. I want to see YOU.. I want to show YOU and ask about this Pillow that is in the top of the Bed.. is this suppose to be here with Me.. because if you are going to leave something behind.. I don't need the pillow One.. the Shape of a Heart.. I wanted to ask YOU.. if this is your Heart.. or the Shape of this Heart is what YOU are trying to tell Me.. at least let me have the Real One.. I don't need a Fake Heart.. I can't even tell this Fake Heart anything.. what am I suppose to do.. Hold this Pillow.. this Shape of Your Heart and cry on it because I be missing YOU.. to tell YOU how Much I love YOU.. and How much I need YOU still.. but I need YOU here.. so that I want to trade this One for the real One.. the One that I need the Most.. I want to ask YOU.. I want Your Heart.. Because I need YOU close.. I want Your Heart so that I can lay my Head of the Heart and ask if It can beat for Me.. can I hear the sound of the beating of your Heart.. if My Head is able to lay on top of Your Heart.. I know for sure I can hear something.. I want to hear Your Heart.. because I need YOU.. I want to tell Your Heart.. I need YOU and I miss YOU.. and I want to spend the rest of my life just loving YOU and telling YOU how much I missed you.. to whisper to Your Heart.. do YOU love me too.. will you please give me an answer if YOU can love me too.. I want to hear you say Yes YOU can love me too.. the way I love YOU.. I have never stopped loving YOU but always kept on missing YOU.. as I am looking up and at the Pillow.. I would get UP slowly.. walking toward the Bed.. My Hands grabs and holds.. my arms wraps around this Pillow.. the Shape of a Heart.. why is this Heart here.. I want the Real one.. Your Real Heart.. and My arms would squeeze this Pillow softly and gently.. Why did YOU not take this Pillow with YOU.. why did you leave this Pillow behind.. the shape of a Heart.. what are you trying to tell me.. no matter How many times I ask this Heart.. this Pillow.. the Shape of the Heart.. I can ask million times of words.. will it answer me if I ask that much.. that is why I wanted to know are you trying to tell me something because it already hurts me too much unable to tell YOU how much I want to be with YOU.. it hurts me more than YOU that I can't tell you right Now even though YOU know my Heart.. How much more do I must needs to wait for YOU to know how much I need YOU.. I really need you tonight because My Arms.. My arms wants to hold YOU close.. this Pillow cannot say a Word.. the Shape of this Heart can't tell me NO words but I know that YOU can.. if YOU just leave Your Heart.. your real Heart with me.. I know that I can tell YOU.. YOU know how much I love YOU.. do YOU know How much I love YOU.. can you please tell me that YOU know my Heart.. as I am Holding the Shape of the Heart.. the Pillow YOU have left behind.. I am walking Out of the room holding this Shape of the Heart.. I really want to hold YOU.. if I can only see your Real Heart.. and let it falls into my Hands.. I will gently wrap my around your Heart and I will say to Your Heart.. do YOU know how long my arms been waiting for a day like this.. to tell YOU.. Not just by words but even through my eyes and my arms.. Holding your Heart.. as my hand grab the door knob to turn.. opening the Back door and I walk out side as the door closes behind me.. My arms are holding.. wrapped around this Pillow.. the shape of Heart.. as I look Up.. I am standing out side as I turn to look up the Moon.. the Can of Beer is on top of the table.. and I am looking at the MOON again.. Do you see this.. Look at my arms Please.. LOOK what I am holding.. It is a shape of a Heart.. I never thought it be in my room.. the Pillow.. the Shape of the Heart came to the room.. sitting on top of the Bed.. I never expected it be a Shape of a Heart.. I looked at the Pillow closely and I paused.. My Heart jumped within me saying.. I see a Heart.. the Shape of a Heart.. which YOU have left behind.. why didn't you tell me that YOU wanted to leave this Shape of Heart behind.. are you trying to tell me to catch it.. to hold It.. to Love It.. to take care of It until YOU come back.. I wanted to tell YOU.. confess how much I love YOU.. instead I see a Pillow.. a shape of a Heart sitting on top of my bed waiting for me to see it.. I just drank few beers tonight..

I want to step on this Line.. but what would happen if I can cross over this Line.. would YOU open the Door.. would this Glass Wall slide over and let me in.. so My foot would cross over the Line.. and I would just look through the Glass Wall.. But that Heart.. my finger Points to Your Heart.. Can I touch this Heart.. I want to Have this Heart.. I wonder how does Your Heart feel.. if it is Soft.. Can I lay on top of Your Heart like it is a Pillow.. I am just standing here just dreaming.. wondering and wishing that I have this Heart.. How about my other Foot cross over this Line.. I wonder what would happen.. Can I cross the Line.. can the Other Foot cross over too.. I want to go over and touch.. Hold this Giant Heart and I want to see if Your Heart is Soft.. is it tender.. can Your Heart be so Kind and so Sweet.. How about my lip kisses Your Heart.. would my Lip be sealed to Your Heart.. attached.. all I can do is think and wonder.. but my two eyes are just looking through this Glass Wall.. this Big Window..

Pretty Please.. Help me how to get to this Heart.. Your Heart.. this Giant Heart..

I came this Far.. why don't you open this Glass wall.. I am here to have this Heart.. SO Please.. Open this Glass wall or tell me how to get in.. I know there is NO door or lock.. then what Am I suppose to do.. How do I get to this BIG GIANT Heart.. I want it.. I want to have this Heart but it seems impossible.. even crossing the line over.. there is another Line I see and has written X over it.. means I cannot cross over no more.. so what am I suppose to do.. and I turn to the right to look over.. there is a Microphone.. and I am wondering.. is this the answer.. is this the key.. Am I suppose to say something on this microphone.. what if my Voice is very loud.. and wakes UP your Heart.. I don't want to sound like a person who makes Your Heart to feel shiver or scared.. I want to tell Your Heart.. and I turn to look at Your Picture.. OH YEAH.. and I am looking through the Glass wall.. Looking at the Giant Heart.. so I am suppose to tell YOU how My Heart feels HUH.. I am suppose to say the words what YOUR HEART wants to hear or what is on my Mind and Heart.. Let me try my way then.. so My hand grabs the Microphone.. and my lip gets close to the Microphone.. I want Your Heart.. DO you know how much I want Your Heart.. I would look at your Picture.. do YOU know that I want to see YOU.. that YOU are the Most prettiest.. Most Beautiful that my eyes ever seen.. I know you have left this picture.. because why Would you leave this Picture behind.. did YOU know that I was the one to enter the Door.. and yes.. I stopped to have a peek.. and walk through the door.. I saw this Picture laying on the Floor.. I went over to pick it up.. but I knew.. I wanted your Heart.. when I stopped by the Line and I looked through the Glass wall.. My Breathe was taken away and my Mind was blown into pieces.. because I saw How BIG.. the Giant Heart was by the center of the floor.. I am not sure how many fellows in this world would be able to know this but I knew when I first saw Your Heart.. this Big.. This Giant Heart.. I fell in love.. I wanted this Heart.. I wanted to touch this Heart.. I want to have Your Heart right Now.. would you please show or tell me the answer.. that I need Your Heart.. I just can't live without Your Heart because I need Your Heart right Now.. How am I suppose to get this Heart.. as my hand holding the Microphone and I am speaking through the Microphone..

I know that I can't leave without first getting Your Heart.. as I am looking around.. I look down.. there is a Third Line and I see the Glass Jar.. it is an Empty Glass Jar.. now My lip smiles more because.. if I can cross two Lines.. and by the time I go to the third line I know I am able to go to the Glass Jar.. so.. is this Glass jar for Me.. is this really for me.. you have left this Behind so that I am able to go get this Glass Jar.. I know it is empty right Now.. but once I have put my hands on it.. I know I am going to grab Your Big Heart.. But.. I need to know.. How do I get to Your Heart after I am able to have the Empty Glass Jar.. I would hold the Microphone in my hand and I would speak.. Please tell me.. I want to know how to get to Your Heart..

I put my lip on the Microphone.. can I say something.. How does Your Heart feel.. if I can hold and touch Your Heart.. is Your Heart soft and tender.. if I lay my head ON top of Your Big Heart.. is it like a Pillow.. would it be soft.. I want to hold Your Heart if it is soft and I want to love it.. and I would turn to Look at your Picture.. I put my Lip on the Microphone.. and I would speak.. Do you know that I loved YOU since I put my eyes on You.. from the first time I glanced Your way.. toward your direction..

How would my Heart feel or react when I be close to YOU.. and since I am unable to see YOU.. this is the reason why it hurts me the most.. if YOU wonder about my Pains and why I deal with great sufferings.. I will tell YOU why.. it is because I miss YOU.. did YOU ever felt when YOU be missing someone.. for so long YOU are just missing.. and it never heals because I keep on missing YOU and it has been a while now..
